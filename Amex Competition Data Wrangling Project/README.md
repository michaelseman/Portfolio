This is some work I did with the Amex Competition Dataset on kaggle (found here:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hotsonhonet/amex-competition/versions/1?resource=download)

I employed many of the techniques I've learned, documented my observations throughout while specifically focusing on Feature Importance and Feature Selection.
