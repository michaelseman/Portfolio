# NBA 2021 Three Point Analysis

This is the Tableau work I did for my final Intro to Data Analytics class final project.

Included is a tableau packaged workbook and the accompanying powerpoint presentation.

The work division was as follows: my partner did the scatterplots, text table, and some light data cleaning.  All the other visualizations, dashboard, and powerpoint presentation were done by me.
