# NBA 2021 3pt Analysis

This is the Tableau work I did for my final Intro to Data Analytics class final project.

All the work is my own side from the scatterplot and text table, which my partner did.  The dashboard and all other visualizations were done by me alone.

The included powerpoint presentation was also done by me.
