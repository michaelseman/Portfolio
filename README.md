# Portfolio
This Portfolio consists of SQL, Talbeau, R, and Python.

The work consists of projects done with Miami-Dade College's Data Analytics BS program and personal projects to showcase my skills and growth.

In the future I will be adding more material to show all my award winning work with the Miami Dade County 311 dataset.

Included are a desription of my fake company, an export file to create the DB, an EER diagram, and some sample queries.
