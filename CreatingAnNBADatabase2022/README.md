# Creating an NBA Database using SSMS (2021-2022)

This was my work done for SQL Implementation class.

The NBA Players Stats data was taken from Kaggle while the NBA Team and Player Info was gather via python webscraping.

Included are: 
* .csv files used for bulk insert containing all the data for the DB
* an SQL to create the database along with some sample queries.
* a python notebook containing the code used to webscrape
* an htm file used in conjuction with that python notebook


https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/nba-player-stats is the source for the player stats .csv
