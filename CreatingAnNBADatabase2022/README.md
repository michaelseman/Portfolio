# Creating an NBA Database using SSMS (2021-2022)

This was my work done for SQL Implementation class.

The NBA Players Stats data was taken from Kaggle while the NBA Team and Player Info was gather via python webscraping.  
The webscraping was outside of the purview of the class and was learned on my own.

Included are: 
* .csv files used for bulk insert containing all the data for the DB
* an SQL to create the database along with some sample queries.
* a python notebook containing the code used to webscrape
* an htm file used in conjuction with that python notebook

All the webscraping and database implementation was my own work.  Database design was a collaboration with my partner.  Individual query work is noted inside the .sql file.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/nba-player-stats is the source for the player stats .csv
