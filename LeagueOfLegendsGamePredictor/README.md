This is a repository for the files used to create a League of Legends Game Predictor App.
We used a dataset that contains team stats at the 10 minute mark of the game.
Games can end as quickly as 15 minutes or last longer than an hour.
Generally games last around 25-30 minutes yet we were able to predict their outcome with 73% accuracy with stats through 10 minutes.
