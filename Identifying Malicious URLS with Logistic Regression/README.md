# Identifying Malicious URLS with Logistic Regression using R

This folder contains R notebook file of a project I did in Data Security and Governance class.

We were given a data set and wanted to use regression to come up with a method to predict whether URLs were malicious (defacement) or not (benign).

I worked in tandem with Frank Rodriguez and Joemichael Alvarez on this project.  
Joemichael tackled a lot of the EDA, while Frank and I worked together on the R programming portion.

We were new to regression and R at the time and had mainly dealt with Linear Regression (you can see this in our work).  
We were able to study up on Logistic Regression for this project and code it in R, despite having no previous experience in it.

I like this project because I feel you can see our growth from start to finish in the work we did, and the benefits out going outside the scope of a class to learn new concepts.
