# Creating a Liquor Distrubtor's Database from Scratch Using MySQL

This project was done as part of my Database Management and Design class using MySql.

I used excel functions to randomly generate order quantities as well as which customerid was placing the order.  This information was use to populate the orders table.

FakeNameGenerator.com was used to generate a list of customers and employees for their respective tables.

All information for products being sold including name, type, and pricing was taken from real life data in use in the restaurant industry at the time of creation.

Included are a desription of my fake company, an export file to create the DB, an EER diagram, and some sample queries.
