# An Analysis of 311 Services in Miami Dade County

This contains the work I did for my summer research internship for the STEM Insitute at Miami Dade College

Included is a pdf of my final work that was presented at the 2022 STEM + Interdisciplinary Research Symposium.  My poster was awarded the third place prize.

I will be adding my final tableau workbook, my working notebooks and dashboards, my analysis in R, and my datacleaning done in python.
