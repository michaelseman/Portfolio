# An Analysis of 311 Services in Miami Dade County

This contains the work I did for my summer research internship for the STEM Insitute at Miami Dade College

Included is a pdf of my final poster and an R Notebook of my ANOVA and TUKEY HSD tests regarding Department and Submission Method as independent variables on the dependent variable Actual Ticket completion time.

My final work that was presented at the 2022 STEM + Interdisciplinary Research Symposium was awarded the third place prize.

I will be adding my final tableau workbook, my working notebooks and dashboards, and my datacleaning done in python.
